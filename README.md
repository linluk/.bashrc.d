# Here lives my Bash-Config

My `~/.bashrc`'s only task is to source the `*.sh` files in this directory.

It does it like that:

```sh
# If not running interactively, don't do anything
case $- in
    *i*) ;;
      *) return;;
esac

# source *.sh files from ~/.bashrc.d/
# files are named starting with 2-digit numbers
# so they should be sourced in the correct order
if [ -d ~/.bashrc.d/ ]; then
    for file in ~/.bashrc.d/*.sh; do
        [ -r "$file" ] && . "$file"
        # echo $file
    done
    unset file
fi
```

# How to use

Add the above code to your `.bashrc` (or replace it with it) and clone this repository to `~/.bashrc.d`:

```sh
cd ~/
git clone --depth 1 git@github.com:linluk/.bashrc.d.git
```

# What it does

Please read the source code! Some of it has comments, some is self-explanatory, some is quite crappy, some things might work, some things might not, ...
